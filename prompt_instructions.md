 check that out we went through a little overview of the existing Tesla UI kind of get a look and feel of how it works as well as go through and set up the initial framework for our UI in that video we implemented this left hand screen and right hand screen as well as a bottom bar along the top here we have some text and a Nikon indicating lock and unlock all this is provided to us by AC plus class and not hard-coded so if you want to get up to speed with what we've done so far and you haven't seen the last video go ahead and check that out so let's go ahead and dig right into it one thing that I did notice earlier today when it's something like 707 am it doesn't actually show the Zero part here you don't see the Zero part either it would just show 7 7 am so that is a little bug that we have in the code and we can fix that by doing our hour minute minute here so if we rerun that that will fix our issue so we don't really see it now because it's 48 but if it was 708 am it would show 708 instead of 7 8 am all right now let's go ahead and implement this search navigation box here I'm going to make a new component and put it in the right hand side of the screen and I'm going to start out by making a rectangle so since this component is only going to be used within our right screen component I'm actually going to just create it and put it in the right screen folder let's create a new qml file and we'll want it in the UI right screen folder and let's call this navigation search box.qml cool and let's start out with a rectangle ID we'll say nav search box and now let's go ahead and take a look so this is going to be somewhat of kind of like a gray white color and to get that color I usually just go to Google and look up Color Picker and let's see I'll find one that I think looks good I think that looks good so I'll copy this hex value here and I'll give this color all right and now for the anchors and width and height uh for the component I'll actually go and do that when I create the component instead of putting it in this uh component code that way it's a little more reusable so the only other thing I think I want to do now is put a radius on this rectangle so let's go ahead and put a radius of 5. all right now let's go to our right screen and actually let's run Q make since we added a new um qml file and since this navigation search box.uml file is in the same directory as the right screen.qml we can actually just go ahead and use this component by using its name so let's go here navigation search box there we go and let's call it nav search box all right now let's set up some anchors for it we can see here uh we can probably anchor the left side to the left side of the lock screen icon and then the top of the navigation search box I'll just anchor off the bottom of that lock screen or I'm sorry the lock icon um and then give it a top margin to give it a little bit of spacing I won't add any left margin since it looks like it lines up pretty well so let's go ahead and do that anchors left we're going to say is our lock icon dot left and top we will anchor off the lock icon at the bottom and give it a top margin of 20. actually let's do 15. okay the last thing we want to do is set up the width and height of this component so for the width I think I'll do about one third of this screen since it looks like it's about a third I think that will be good and then for the height I'll just try something out like 1 12 and see how it looks so let's go ahead and do that width I said is going to be parent dot width times one third and the height let's do parent dot height times 1 12. all right now we can run that and see how it looks all right that actually looks pretty good I think it's kind of hard to see with this uh map color background and and this box so I'm actually going to change the map plugin from open source maps to I think mapbox GL might look a little better let's go here and we'll do map box GL and let's run that to how it looks all right so the map box GL I actually kind of like this map look a little better um I think with the map box GL uh right now since I'm in a development environment I can use it but I think if I wanted to actually use it in a production environment I would have to possibly purchase some kind of license uh so if you end up using mapboxgl just make sure that you look into what the licensing entails and and pricing if there is any but let's go ahead and actually change this color a little bit to make it I think a little more gray um all right let's try this one let's go down to actually let's go into our navigation search box and change this color and let's see how that looks all right I think that looks a little better um I think you can see a little better but our margins are set up good and I actually like the width and height that it is uh set to as well so now let's go ahead and add this um search icon here so I'll go to Flat icon here and let's search for search it should be a magnifying glass this one looks pretty good let's edit the icon and we want a little more of a gray color I think actually let's make a little darker so that uh it looks better on the search box all right I think that looks good we'll copy this to keep it for the text color as well but let's go ahead and download this free download and now we'll go to our downloads folder let's grab that search and put it into our assets folder all right yeah and then in our QRC file let's go ahead and add an existing file and grab that search.png good and now in our navigation search box let's go ahead and add an image and we'll call this search icon let's set the source to this search.png and let's actually run Q make since we added a new file to our QRC file all right and now let's take a look at how we want to set up this uh search icon so within the context of the navigation search box where this search icon lives looks like it'll be vertically centered within it and then left margin or I'm sorry the left anchor will be anchored to the left of the parent with a pretty significant margin so I think I'll try something like 25 for the left margin so let's go ahead and do that let's do anchors left turn dot left margins I'm like 25 and then vertical Center will be parent dot vertical Center now the last thing we want to do is the width and height of it uh the height I think I'll do about 45 of the height of the parent and then I will leave the width but set the fill mode so that it'll scale accordingly so let's do height parent dot height times 0.45 and then fill mode Let's do image preserve aspect of it okay and I think we should be able to run that okay so here we can see the search icon within our search navigation box and I think that looks pretty good so I won't change any of the anchors or the width and height of it let's go back to our screenshot here and then this navigation search text here it will be kind of like a placeholder text so let's go ahead and add that in now it'll just be text that's aligned vertically within this parent here and be the same color as the search icon so let's actually grab that color that we had here and then go back to our navigation search box qml and let's add a text component here and we'll just call this navigation placeholder text set the color of it to that value we copied we'll set the text to say navigate I think it was let's just make sure yes all right and now let's set up some anchors we set the vertical Center was going to be in the parent.vertical center the left of it is going to be to the right of the search icon and let's give it a left margin of about 20. and let's see how that looks okay that looks pretty good so now we have this navigation search box here with this navigate placeholder text and the search icon so now what we're going to want to do is put kind of a text input here and whenever we use the text input we want this navigate placeholder text to go invisible so I think I'm going to put a text input here that will have the same height as the parent and then for the width of it I'm going to have it set by the anchors so I'll anchor the right of the text input to the parent right and then the left of it to the right of this search icon and that should set up the width so let's go ahead and put text input here ID we'll call this navigation text input and the anchors we said top will be parent.top bottom is bottom right we said here right and then the left will do the search icon dot right and we'll give it a left margin of 20. so now if we run this here we go and we have a input here so we can see that the input is actually in the top left of the text input component so we're going to want to change the alignment of it at the very least to have the vertical alignment within the vertical of the component itself let's go do that vertical alignment text Dot align the center and then let's also make this text a little bigger let's do something like 16 point font so font.pixel size we'll do 16. all right let's put some text in here okay I think that looks really good so the last thing we want to do on this is let's make the navigate um placeholder text not visible whenever there's text in the text input so let's go ahead and do that in our navigation placeholder text let's add a visible property here visible and we only want it visible when the text of navigation text input is equal to nothing so let's actually do that we'll do this Dot text equals to nothing so if there's any text within our navigation text input this navigate text should be invisible and then when we delete everything it should become visible again so let's try that out all right so we have our navigate placeholder text here if we click it it's still good and then the second we put something in h you can see that it has disappeared and then when we delete it it comes back I think the only other thing is potentially there might be some clipping if the text is too long so let's see yes so this will overrun the parent if the text is too long so I think if we just set clip to true here that should change it all right so now let's go here and do the quick brown jumps over the lazy dog good so now we can see that if the text is overrunning the width of the text input it won't go over our other component it will clip accordingly but we can always go back as well and see all the text and if we select all and delete placeholder text comes back which is good

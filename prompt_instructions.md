 check that out we went through a little overview of the existing Tesla UI kind of get a look and feel of how it works as well as go through and set up the initial framework for our UI in that video we implemented this left hand screen and right hand screen as well as a bottom bar along the top here we have some text and a Nikon indicating lock and unlock all this is provided to us by AC plus class and not hard-coded so if you want to get up to speed with what we've done so far and you haven't seen the last video go ahead and check that out so let's go ahead and dig right into it one thing that I did notice earlier today when it's something like 707 am it doesn't actually show the Zero part here you don't see the Zero part either it would just show 7 7 am so that is a little bug that we have in the code and we can fix that by doing our hour minute minute here so if we rerun that that will fix our issue so we don't really see it now because it's 48 but if it was 708 am it would show 708 instead of 7 8 am all right now let's go ahead and implement this search navigation box here I'm going to make a new component and put it in the right hand side of the screen and I'm going to start out by making a rectangle so since this component is only going to be used within our right screen component I'm actually going to just create it and put it in the right screen folder let's create a new qml file and we'll want it in the UI right screen folder and let's call this navigation search box.qml cool and let's start out with a rectangle ID we'll say nav search box and now let's go ahead and take a look so this is going to be somewhat of kind of like a gray white color and to get that color I usually just go to Google and look up Color Picker and let's see I'll find one that I think looks good I think that looks good so I'll copy this hex value here and I'll give this color all right and now for the anchors and width and height uh for the component I'll actually go and do that when I create the component instead of putting it in this uh component code that way it's a little more reusable so the only other thing I think I want to do now is put a radius on this rectangle so let's go ahead and put a radius of 5. all right now let's go to our right screen and actually let's run Q make since we added a new um qml file and since this navigation search box.uml file is in the same directory as the right screen.qml we can actually just go ahead and use this component by using its name so let's go here navigation search box there we go and let's call it nav search box all right now let's set up some anchors for it we can see here uh we can probably anchor the left side to the left side of the lock screen icon and then the top of the navigation search box I'll just anchor off the bottom of that lock screen or I'm sorry the lock icon um and then give it a top margin to give it a little bit of spacing I won't add any left margin since it looks like it lines up pretty well so let's go ahead and do that anchors left we're going to say is our lock icon dot left and top we will anchor off the lock icon at the bottom and give it a top margin of 20. actually let's do 15. okay the last thing we want to do is set up the width and height of this component so for the width I think I'll do about one third of this screen since it looks like it's about a third I think that will be good and then for the height I'll just try something out like 1 12 and see how it looks so let's go ahead and do that width I said is going to be parent dot width times one third and the height let's do parent dot height times 1 12. all right now we can run that and see how it looks all right that actually looks pretty good I think it's kind of hard to see with this uh map color background and and this box so I'm actually going to change the map plugin from open source maps to I think mapbox GL might look a little better let's go here and we'll do map box GL and let's run that to how it looks all right so the map box GL I actually kind of like this map look a little better um I think with the map box GL uh right now since I'm in a development environment I can use it but I think if I wanted to actually use it in a production environment I would have to possibly purchase some kind of license uh so if you end up using mapboxgl just make sure that you look into what the licensing entails and and pricing if there is any but let's go ahead and actually change this color a little bit to make it I think a little more gray um all right let's try this one let's go down to actually let's go into our navigation search box and change this color and let's see how that looks all right I think that looks a little better um I think you can see a little better but our margins are set up good and I actually like the width and height that it is uh set to as well so now let's go ahead and add this um search icon here so I'll go to Flat icon here and let's search for search it should be a magnifying glass this one looks pretty good let's edit the icon and we want a little more of a gray color I think actually let's make a little darker so that uh it looks better on the search box all right I think that looks good we'll copy this to keep it for the text color as well but let's go ahead and download this free download and now we'll go to our downloads folder let's grab that search and put it into our assets folder all right yeah and then in our QRC file let's go ahead and add an existing file and grab that search.png good and now in our navigation search box let's go ahead and add an image and we'll call this search icon let's set the source to this search.png and let's actually run Q make since we added a new file to our QRC file all right and now let's take a look at how we want to set up this uh search icon so within the context of the navigation search box where this search icon lives looks like it'll be vertically centered within it and then left margin or I'm sorry the left anchor will be anchored to the left of the parent with a pretty significant margin so I think I'll try something like 25 for the left margin so let's go ahead and do that let's do anchors left turn dot left margins I'm like 25 and then vertical Center will be parent dot vertical Center now the last thing we want to do is the width and height of it uh the height I think I'll do about 45 of the height of the parent and then I will leave the width but set the fill mode so that it'll scale accordingly so let's do height parent dot height times 0.45 and then fill mode Let's do image preserve aspect of it okay and I think we should be able to run that okay so here we can see the search icon within our search navigation box and I think that looks pretty good so I won't change any of the anchors or the width and height of it let's go back to our screenshot here and then this navigation search text here it will be kind of like a placeholder text so let's go ahead and add that in now it'll just be text that's aligned vertically within this parent here and be the same color as the search icon so let's actually grab that color that we had here and then go back to our navigation search box qml and let's add a text component here and we'll just call this navigation placeholder text set the color of it to that value we copied we'll set the text to say navigate I think it was let's just make sure yes all right and now let's set up some anchors we set the vertical Center was going to be in the parent.vertical center the left of it is going to be to the right of the search icon and let's give it a left margin of about 20. and let's see how that looks okay that looks pretty good so now we have this navigation search box here with this navigate placeholder text and the search icon so now what we're going to want to do is put kind of a text input here and whenever we use the text input we want this navigate placeholder text to go invisible so I think I'm going to put a text input here that will have the same height as the parent and then for the width of it I'm going to have it set by the anchors so I'll anchor the right of the text input to the parent right and then the left of it to the right of this search icon and that should set up the width so let's go ahead and put text input here ID we'll call this navigation text input and the anchors we said top will be parent.top bottom is bottom right we said here right and then the left will do the search icon dot right and we'll give it a left margin of 20. so now if we run this here we go and we have a input here so we can see that the input is actually in the top left of the text input component so we're going to want to change the alignment of it at the very least to have the vertical alignment within the vertical of the component itself let's go do that vertical alignment text Dot align the center and then let's also make this text a little bigger let's do something like 16 point font so font.pixel size we'll do 16. all right let's put some text in here okay I think that looks really good so the last thing we want to do on this is let's make the navigate um placeholder text not visible whenever there's text in the text input so let's go ahead and do that in our navigation placeholder text let's add a visible property here visible and we only want it visible when the text of navigation text input is equal to nothing so let's actually do that we'll do this Dot text equals to nothing so if there's any text within our navigation text input this navigate text should be invisible and then when we delete everything it should become visible again so let's try that out all right so we have our navigate placeholder text here if we click it it's still good and then the second we put something in h you can see that it has disappeared and then when we delete it it comes back I think the only other thing is potentially there might be some clipping if the text is too long so let's see yes so this will overrun the parent if the text is too long so I think if we just set clip to true here that should change it all right so now let's go here and do the quick brown jumps over the lazy dog good so now we can see that if the text is overrunning the width of the text input it won't go over our other component it will clip accordingly but we can always go back as well and see all the text and if we select all and delete placeholder text comes back which is good

## Continuing today to edit the Tesla UI 
I'm going to go ahead and add some components to the Bottom bar here just give it some more visual items here so let's go down here and let's take a look we have temperature controls for the driver's side and the passenger side volume control as well as some quick icons here I think I'll actually just leave the icons out um I don't think going around searching for icons is going to be that exciting so let's go ahead and just do the temperature control for right now first I think I want to set up a c plus that will handle the temperature setting for the driver side and the passenger side so let's go ahead and our controllers add a new C plus class here twos and we want it to actually live not in our UI folder but in our controllers and the class name let's just call it HVAC Handler let's inherit Q object next and finish so for the HVAC Handler class we're just going to have a Q property here for the Target temperature so let's go ahead and add a key property to the property and we end and Target temperature good and then let's add a private keyword here so that when we generate our missing Q property members it will put it in private good now let's move this over to the C plus and do the same thing with the setter good and now in our Constructor let's set up the initial value or M Target temperature and let's just call it 70. good I think we'll need one more method in this HVAC Handler class and that will be to handle increasing and decreasing the value of this target temperature if you haven't seen my other videos The Way We expose a method to qml is using this Q invokable macro void increment Target temperature and we'll give it a constant vowel so we can use just one method to increase and decrease the target temperature by passing either a negative one or a positive one to the method let's go ahead and add this into our C plus plus and let's say int new Target Temp equals our current temp plus our Val so if we pass a negative one it'll actually just subtract a 1 from here or if we pass a positive one it will increase this and now let's go ahead and set our Target temperature to our new Target so I think that will take care of increasing and decreasing and we have a Target temperature so for our uses we're going to actually have two instances of HVAC Handler one for the driver's side and one for the passenger side so let's go to our main.cpp and we'll add the header file and then here let's create two instances of it one for the driver and one for the passenger there's a HVAC Handler m driver HVAC Handler and then one for the passenger which fact Handler m passenger HVAC okay and then let's set our context property here actually we can just copy this twice and for the driver's side let's just call this driver track and for passenger we'll call it passenger HVAC here we'll pass in the driver a track Handler and here we'll pass in the passenger track Handler so let's go back to our screenshot here so what we're going to do is add an HVAC component here that will have a button for the decrement button for the increment and then a text display for the actual Target temperature so I think I'll just make one component that I'll reuse one for here and then one here so let's go ahead and create a new component in our Bottom bar cute qml file we want this to live in our UI Bottom bar folder and let's just call this HVAC component component good so how I think I'm going to make this is I'm going to have a rectangle here text and then a rectangle here and then the rectangle itself will have a mouse area that will capture input and then decrease or increase depending on which one they click so let's go ahead and add that here rectangle and we'll call this the decrement button document button and let's take a look again to see what we want to do for anchors widths and Heights so if we consider this whole unit here as our HVAC component and look at the decrement button the left of it will anchor to the left of the actual HVAC component and then the height of it will be probably the same height as our HVAC component which we'll set to the height of the Bottom bar as well so let's go ahead and do all that so let's do anchors let's say left is parent.left and then the top is going to be parent.top and bottom is going to be parent dot bottom so since we set the top and bottom anchors that will take care of the height of this decrement button and as long as we set the height of the actual HVAC component to the height of the status bar it'll make this decrement button the same height as that so the only thing that we need to set is the actual width of this component and I think let's just try half of the actual height of it so let's do that width is going to be height divided by 2 and so that we can visualize it see how it looks let's give it a color of orange so let's run qmake actually since we added this new component here and in our Bottom bar let's go ahead and add a new HVAC component and we'll call this passenger HVAC control and let's take a look so the HVAC control itself will set a left anchor to the right of this car icon and give it a really big left margin and then we'll set the top and bottom anchor to the top and bottom of the Bottom bar that will set up the height of it as well let's go anchors top is parent dot top bottom is parent dot bottom and again the parent of this HVAC component is the Bottom bar itself so left let's do car settings icon dot right and left margin let's start out with 150. and let's see how that looks okay so here we can see our HVAC component and we can see our decrement button which actually looks pretty good as long as we set that color to Black and then add some text like a left arrow in there I think that will look really good so let's go back to our HVAC component let's change this back to black and then let's actually add some text in here and we'll call this decrement text and this would be centered in our apparent so we're going to have this decrement text centered within our decrement button here and then let's say the text is going to be this left Arrow and let's set font.pixel size to let's try 12. see how that looks open the color so for the color let's actually grab that same color that we use in our navigation search box so this color right here and let's see how that looks um all right so that looks good in terms of size it is a little bit on the dark side with this black background so actually let's go back to the Color Picker set it to a lighter color let's try this one put it here and before we test that out let's go ahead and add that Target temperature text as well right here so let's put a new component here text and we'll call this target temperature text and let's take a look at the anchors of it the left of it will be to the right of the decrement button and then the vertical Center we can actually do vertical center of the actual HVAC component as well so let's go ahead and do that anchors left is going to be decrement button dot right left margin let's just add 15. and then vertical Center let's do parent dot vertical Center and then for the text color we're actually going to want all this to be the same color so let's go ahead and just add a property here property string font color and we'll grab this here so that we can just use Font color here and then the same one here color font color and this way anytime we want to change the color of the HVAC component we don't have to go in and change it everywhere we can just change it up here and it'll be applied to the whole component now for the pixel size it's going to be a quite big so let's change this pixel size to something like 24 font dot pixel size 24 and for right now the text let's hard code it to 70 and we'll actually set it to the HVAC Handler later so let's see how that looks okay I think that looks pretty good um yeah looks pretty good I think the only other thing that we want to do is let's add the increment button so we can just copy this here down here we'll call this the increment button and then let's take a look at the anchors the left of it will be to the right of the text here and we'll give it the same margin that we gave this from this so that will be equidistant over here so let's go ahead and do that left is going to be our Target temperature right and we'll leave the top and bottom margin so set up the height of this increment button add that left margin which will match this one here which is 15. and the text we'll call increment text and we'll change this to a right arrow and now let's see how that looks all right that looks really good and now let's just add one for our passenger side so let's go take a look there's a volume icon here that we can probably anchor off of but for right now let's just put it in and we'll adjust the anchors later so let's go to our Bottom bar all right so let's copy this whole component here all right so actually this should be our driver HVAC control and this will be our passenger HVAC control so for the passenger one let's just change the right margin to our parent.write and give it a right margin of 150 and later when we put the volume icon we'll adjust this passenger HVAC control to Anchor off of that but for right now this will just be a placeholder so let's take a look at that okay good so now we have a driver's side HVAC control and a passenger side HVAC control now let's go ahead and add the connections in so that this here only affects our driver HVAC controller and this one here only affects our passenger HVAC controller all right so since we're using the same HVAC component for both our driver side and passenger side we can't just go into our HVAC component here for example and Target temperature say this driver HVAC dot Target temperature if we did this the driver side and passenger side would always read the same value and not have independent control so let's go back actually we need to change that anyways but let's add a property here property far HVAC controller and in our Bottom bar let's set that property for our driver HVAC control here HVAC controller will be our driver HVAC and then in our passenger we'll say HVAC controller is passenger HVAC so now when we're in our HVAC component all we have to do is reference this HVAC controller variable and it will utilize the correct one so here for our Target temperature let's do HVAC controller dot Target temperature and now that should reference this target temperature Q property of our respective HVAC controller whether we're in the driver's side or passenger side so let's first make sure that this shows 70 for both all right so we're seeing 70 for both and to make sure that they're independent let's go ahead and implement the increment and decrement buttons so for our decrement button let's add a mouse area fills the entire button and then on clicked we'll have it do the HVAC controller and let and let's see what we named that method hfact handler.h is increment Target temperature so let's actually just copy that and add it here and we'll pass it a negative one now let's go ahead and copy this down to our increment button and we'll pass it a positive one so now we should have the increment and decrement functionality implemented and they should only control their respective HVAC controllers so the passenger side should only uh increment and decrement the passenger HVAC Handler and likewise the driver side should only control the driver's side HVAC controller so let's go ahead and run that all right so now we have our driver's side here if we decrease this we can see that we've set the driver's side to a Target temperature of 62 but the passenger side is still set to 70 and we can increase the 70 and we can see that the passenger side is still independent of the driver's side so this is working well all right so the last thing I think I'm going to implement on this Bottom bar is going to be this volume control here again I think I'm going to leave out these quick access icons they would really just be me looking for icons putting them in here and I think the functionality of them aren't going to be in the scope of this series so we'll just handle the audio for right now so if we take a look at the audio icon here it's going to be very similar to what we have for our HVAC component where we have the increment or I'm sorry the decrement and the increment buttons and then this icon here so let's go ahead and actually look for a volume icon so let's go to Flat icon as always and let's search for volume so I like something like this I hope that there's one with just a single bar okay so here we can see volume one and then that other one was a volume two so I think we'll just have two levels maybe there if there's a third one we can use that but I don't see it so let's just do two volume levels for the indicator icon so let's download this free download okay and then let's go ahead and download that first one which was a two here free download let's go to our downloads and let's take a look at this this is the two so let's just call this Audio Two dot PNG and this is audio one so let's call this audio one let's copy these and put them into our Tesla infotainment UI and our assets then let's go ahead and add that here add existing files audio open all right and then let's run cumake and now before we uh do the qml component let's go ahead and add a new C plus class and we'll call this audio uh controller and we'll have the Base Class BQ object and make sure that it lives in the correct folder which is going to be under our controller oh back actually I think it's controllers controllers okay controllers next and finish all right and now let's add a q property that will keep track of our volume level Cube property and this will be an INT and we'll call this volume level okay and then let's add our private keyword and then generate the missing Q property members let's put this in the C plus as well as this one and just like how we had in our HVAC Handler where we had the increment function we'll do the same thing here use the Q invokable keyword and then increment volume well and then let's go ahead and refactor that C plus plus requires oh I forgot the void keyword here we go and now let's add that here and we'll do end new volume equals m volume level plus Val again if we pass in the negative value it would just decrement this let's just make sure it doesn't go below zero and above uh 100 so we'll do if new volume is less than or equal to zero we'll just set new volume equal to zero likewise if new volume is greater than or equal to 100 just set new volume to 100. then let's set our volume level to new volume all right and that's good now that I'm thinking about it zero should probably have a mute icon so let's and this looks good so I'll download this one all right and then let's go ahead and add that so mute let's copy that and in our Tesla entertainment UI assets put that in there and let's add it here add existing files and our mute and then let's run cumake all right and now since this is going to be living in our Bottom bar I'm just going to add it in our Bottom bar folder let's go ahead and add a new qml file so I live in UI Bottom bar oddly enough if we enter in a path here that isn't valid we can see that it is red but when we were doing it in our C plus plus class creation it didn't give us the same visual indicator so hopefully they fixed that but anyways let's call this the volume control component Dot qml there we go since the volume control component is pretty similar to our HVAC control component let's just go ahead and grab everything from our HVAC component put it in our volume control component to give us something to work off of and let's just comment out first the increment and decrement control because that is something that we'll have to change and then Target temperature text let's actually change this to an image and this will be our volume icon we don't need any of this all right so let's for right now set the audio to as the default icon so we'll do source there we go and I think let's remove this HVAC controller here all right so I think that's good for right now let's go ahead and add this to our Bottom bar right here let's do volume control component ID we'll just call this the volume control all right and now let's give it the same kind of anchors as we have set up for the car settings icon but instead of doing the left with the parent left we'll do the right with the parent right so let's go up to our car settings icon let's grab this anchor here copy and paste it and we'll do right is parent.write and write margin now let's see how that looks all right so we see something here I think but this uh HVAC control component is overlapping with it so let's make sure that we set this just like we set the anchors of here so let's see the passenger HVAC now instead of the parent right it's going to be this volume control left and let's see how that looks okay so it did not look like it changed much so let's comment this out for right now so that it's not overlapping in any way and make sure that this is working properly all right so let's run this and see if we can see anything all right so still seeing some weird stuff happen here as well as something going on here so let's go ahead and change the color of the decrement button to Orange and then the color of the increment button to Blue and see what we're going what's happening here all right not seeing anything still so let's go ahead and check on what's going on decrement button parent left all right uh this is looks good decrement text volume icon here increment button uh left is all right so the left should actually be our volume icon dot right uh that's the dangers of copy and pasting from one component to another let's see what that has changed uh so we're seeing this decrement button here but still not looking good so let's go to our Bottom bar let's see right vertical Center all right so I'm not sure that I set the height of this so let's do since we have the vertical Center set up we don't need that let's do top is parent.top and bottom is parent dot bottom all right so we're seeing our decrement button here but nothing else over here so let's just see our volume control the right of it is our parent right the right margin is going to be 30 and we have our Heights set up so that's good let's go to our volume control component and the increment button all right so for the increment button let's actually just set the right to parent.right and write margin to 15. and then actually we don't probably need a right margin now let's shift everything since this whole component is going to be anchoring towards the right let's see what happens if we change everything to uh right oriented margin so right margin and this will be off of the increment button dot left and then for our decrement button let's just leave that the way it is and see what happens all right so we're seeing our right our increment button now a very big volume icon and then a decrement button as well all right and so this is actually the wrong color it should be white so we got to go back and download all white components I'll uh I'll go ahead and do that off screen so it's not uh too long all right so now I've downloaded all these uh White versions of the controls instead and let's see what's going on here so the volume icon we do not have any width or Heights set up for it so let's go to here let's do about well I think 50 of our hype so let's do height is going to be parent dot height times 0.5 and then film mode Let's do image dot preserve aspect fit and then for the decrement let's go ahead and set the anchors uh right to our audio icon I would call it volume icon volume icon dot left and then we'll do a right margin of 15. now let's see how that looks alright so now we can see here we have our volume icon we have the decrement and increment buttons so that's good let's go ahead and add the HVAC control back in right here uncomment it and then we'll also go into our volume control component and let's change the colors Back to Black and let's see how that looks all right so we're still having some overlapping here so let's see what's going on two hours later all right so I've been doing a little debugging off to the side I didn't record it all because it was it was taking a little bit of time um but I think the reason why we're getting some conflicting anchors um is the component the way that we have it set up uh there's no width to it so when we try to Anchor off of the right side of it it doesn't work uh super well so I think we're gonna have to define a width here for the actual component the HVAC component we have everything set up for the for the children of the component however this item itself has no width so when we're trying to Anchor off of it uh qml doesn't really know how to do that so the way that I'm going to actually set a width for this is by taking its existing width that we have set up here and then making it relative to uh the current width and it might sound confusing but I think it'll make a little more sense as we implement it so let's go ahead and do it and we'll see how that works so first I want to grab the actual width of this component as it displays here so I'm going to make a rectangle angle I want to set up anchors for it the left of it I'm going to have as the decrement button dot left and then the right of it will be the increment button dot right so now this rectangle here which is just a temporary rectangle right now for us to see what the component width is this rectangle has a left anchor to the left of this button and a right anchor to the right of this increment button so so now when the component is completed let's console.log our width so let's go ahead and do that all right so now the width of this component is actually 90 and that's when the width of the screen is 1280. so if we hard code a value of 90 for the width of this component if we end up for some reason changing the width of the screen it's still going to think that the item itself is with 90. if we hard code just as plain 90 in there so to get around that let's make this with is going to be 90 times parent dot with divided by 1280. so we have this 90 here hard coded for our preferred width which is 1280. so if we didn't make any changes to the size of the application when it runs the parent.width which is the Bottom bar width should be 1280 so when it's 1280 it'll be 1280 divided by 1280 which will be a one so the width of this item will remain 90 as long as this parent.width is 1280 but as we scale the actual width it will scale this ratio here accordingly and then adjust the 90 to what it should be so let's see how this works out all right so it still looks good and we'll do the same thing on this volume control component where we set up a width for the item that holds it as well so let's go to our volume control component let's first grab what that width is rectangle and we'll set anchors left is decrement button left and right is our increment button dot right and now when the component is completed we want to console.log our way all right and that is 120. so the same thing here we'll set a width of 120 times a ratio of our parent but with divided by 1280. all right so now that this has a width and our HVAC component has a width we can go back to our Bottom bar and we should be able to uncomment this out and have the right of this HVAC control anchor to the left of the volume control and hopefully that works all right there we go now we can see that this passenger HVAC control is now being anchored properly off of the volume control since this whole component now has a valid width that we can have a right Edge to Anchor off of so here we go this still works and this still works and we haven't implemented this volume control yet so let's go ahead and Implement that so first I think in our main.cpp we need to include our audio controller controllers audio controller and now let's create an object audio controller and we'll call it m audio controller and let's set a context property so we'll say audio controller we'll point to our M Audio controller all right so now in our volume control component let's go to our decrement button and let's add the functionality to audio controller dot increment volume and we'll pass it a negative one and then down in our increment button we'll change it to audiocontroller dot increment and we'll give it a positive one and now if we run the application we aren't going to see any kind of visual indicator that the volume is actually being adjusted so let's set this icon depending on what the volume is let's adjust what the icon shows all right so here in our volume icon instead of having a hard-coded audio two let's make this conditional so let's do the mute first so if audio controller dot volume level is less than or equal to one let's return this mute.png here copy URL and now else if audiocontroller dot volume level is less than or equal to 50. and we will return the audio1.png and otherwise we will just return the audio2.png all right so the way that we have is set up we're first going to check for the mute condition and if it doesn't meet the mute condition but it meets the volume level that's less than or equal to 50. we'll know that it's over one so we don't have to do an additional conditional statement here where we check less than equal to 50 and greater than one because this re has said that it's not less than or equal to one otherwise if none of these conditions are met then audio2.png will be shown so let's run that and see how it works all right so we're seeing that it's muted here and if we increase all right so we can see that it's increasing so it starts off at this uh mute State I think because we haven't set the initial value for Audio Level yes we didn't so in our audio controller let's first set it to um volume level let's set it to 51 so that it starts out with the Audio 2 and then we can go down a couple clicks and see the audio one change all right so now we see that it's a level two if we go down one we can see now that it's uh this level one and if we go down a bunch of times two hours later should eventually go to uh mute there we go all right so now we can see that it's at mute and if we go up we can do that goes back to one so that's good we have this icon that's conditional depending on the volume level but what isn't good is you know we don't know exactly where we are right now whenever we increment and decrement until we get to one of the bounds so let's add a little bit of fanciness to this button to make it show the volume level whenever the volume level changes very temporarily and then show the icon again let's see volume control component let's add some text here actually we're going to grab the text from our HVAC component because I like the look of that let's grab this and we'll go into our volume control add it in here and we'll call this volume text label okay and the anchors will actually have it uh Center in our volume icon so volume icon all right so this text will have the audio controller dot volume level all right so at first we want it to have a visibility of false and we only want to see the volume icon and what we're going to do is anytime the volume level changes we want this to show for say one second then hide and then show the volume icon so let's create a connection here connections and we'll Target our audio controller and we can hook into the signal let's go to our Auto controller here volume level changed so we'll say function on volume level changed first let's make sure that we can grab it let's do test here so now let's change the volume okay good here we can see that anytime we increment or decrement we are getting our debug out here of test so let's change this to say volume icon dot visible is equal to false and our text which is our volume text label dot visible equals to true and now let's add a timer and we'll just call this visible timer we'll give it an interval of let's say 500 milliseconds set the single or set repeat to false so it doesn't keep repeating and then on triggered so whenever there's 500 milliseconds is up we'll say the volume icon we now want to be visible and the volume text label we want to be not visible and actually what we can do instead of setting both of these uh together since they are going to be opposite of one another we can actually just go down to our volume text label and instead of doing visible false we'll have it as volume icon dot visible so we'll have it the inverse of our volume icon visible so whenever the volume icon is not visible then the volume text label will be visible but then when the volume icon is visible this will become invisible again so this is going to be false and this is going to be true all right so now all we need to do is set this timer whenever we set the visible to false so let's do our visible timer dot start all right so now this should take care of it let's try that out all right so now if we decrement one we can see it went down to 50 but then changed back really quick 49 change back I think I'll actually increase this to 1000 or 1000 which is a whole second um and I think we should actually stop the timer so if we keep decrementing the um visible timer it doesn't start the timer over and over again and cause any issues so let's first stop it in case it is running and then start it and we'll actually just put that up there so now let's try that out all right and now let's see 50 good and there's one second there sorry if you can hear my chickens in the background they've decided that now is the time to start squawking but let's try this out go all the way down to let's just go to five for right now and then wait and then yep it went back here so let's go down to zero and it won't go past that and look at that word there and now let's go all the way up to 51 or 52. and there we go this is now showing a two uh the audio two uh image







What's on the agenda today?
We will continue with our editing our Tesla, not Tesla, but our vehicle UI. You can read the prompts which we did yesterday on the cloud.md or on prompt instructions file, the one markdown file. You can read what we did yesterday. We put the navigation bar and we put the temperature and the time settings icon on the right screen. So now we're gonna do most of the bottom bar and this is our personal project but it's kind of inspired by Tesla so that's why I'm taking some of the designs from Tesla. You can look at the image teslasample.teslasample image so that you can see like what we are trying to see but basically we will try to like copy but we try to make it a bit in our own style the bottom bar and yeah you just uh we will just continue doing this and also I have updated the prompt instructions so it's gonna be gonna continue with where it says continuing so this is a actually a YouTube captions from uh from YouTube




gIVE ME PROMPT ON YT CAPTION TO AI - usually I use it for learning, translating videos to notes when studying or giving ai more context say after watching some senior engineer explain some concept online 
FThere is this method which I use whereby I copy all the captions from YouTube which are transcribed then I put it directly to AI because sometimes I let's say I'm reading a tutorial or watching a video whereby an engineer is explaining what they did something but then to put that to give that to AI it's kind of hard to because AI cannot watch videos so I'm looking I'm trying to find this way whereby I will copy the captions of the video then put it give it to AI so perhaps before we start anything perhaps you can give me a prompt like a very powerful prompt whereby the AI will and will know what to do with the caption sometimes the caption comes a bit biased because of their transcribing it's I think it's kind of like because people have different accents and sometimes some of the words are wrong so perhaps you can give me like a good prompt whereby because I want to use this method you know to increase the context of my prompting skills so perhaps you can give me this prompt like maybe put it in a in another markdown file then I will just put it as reference to my text because I'm trying to practice this thing they say specs engineering like it's they're saying it's less about vibe coding but more about specifications and engineering because it's about context so I'm trying to practice the skills so yeah



and then with the UI Tasks 
So with the UI tasks, we will continue, you will read on the prompt instruction and because the guy will explain everything on what he did when he added the HVAC panel down there. But I think he only added the HVAC and the volume, but he did not add the middle icons. But we will add those as well. So we have newer pictures I put there in the images, which is music icon, map icon, phone call icon, then there is video icon, then there is volume max. So it's going to be like when the user clicks until volume max, it's going to give that. And then when the user clicks the icon itself, it's going to change the icon to volume mute. Then there's volume up, it's more like around 80. Then something like a maximum, then it's going to be volume max. Then when you go to, when the user reduces the volume to like zero, then it's going to change the volume zero. And then there's one thing about on the right screen, right next to the username, I think we should have the user icon as well, which I already put in the images. So we will put the user icon right next to the user, next to the user name, like before the username. So yeah.

## Project Overview

**NeoVehicle** is a sophisticated automotive infotainment interface developed as a personal learning project to enhance C++ programming skills, Qt/QML expertise, and software engineering practices. The project demonstrates professional-grade automotive UI development with modern design patterns and interactive user experience.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Controllers (C++)
- **System Controller**: Manages core vehicle state (lock status, temperature, time, user data)
- **HvacHandler**: Independent climate control for driver and passenger zones (50-90°F range)
- **AudioController**: Volume management system with dynamic visual feedback (0-100 levels)

### Frontend Components (QML)
- **Modular Design**: Reusable component architecture with clean separation of concerns
- **Property Binding**: Real-time UI updates using Qt's reactive property system
- **Event Handling**: Robust mouse area interactions with immediate visual feedback

### Integration Patterns
- **C++/QML Bridge**: Seamless data flow using Q_PROPERTY and Q_INVOKABLE macros
- **Signal-Slot System**: Event-driven programming for responsive user interactions
- **Resource Management**: Efficient asset handling through Qt's resource system

## Current Features

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Lock/Unlock Control**: Visual toggle with padlock icon feedback
- **Real-time Clock**: Automatic time updates with proper formatting
- **Temperature Display**: Current outdoor temperature monitoring
- **Recording Indicator**: Visual recording status with animated dot
- **User Profile**: User icon and name display

### Climate Control System
- **Dual-Zone HVAC**: Independent driver and passenger temperature controls
- **Interactive Buttons**: Increment/decrement with immediate temperature display
- **Temperature Constraints**: Safe operating range (50-90°F) with boundary protection
- **Responsive Design**: Scalable components that adapt to screen dimensions

### Audio Management
- **Dynamic Volume Control**: Four-state icon system based on volume levels
  - Mute (≤0): Volume mute icon
  - Zero (≤1): Volume zero icon  
  - Medium (≤50): Volume up icon
  - High (>50): Volume max icon
- **Temporary Feedback**: Volume level display appears briefly during adjustment
- **Smooth Transitions**: Timer-based UI state management for polished experience

### Navigation Interface
- **Search Integration**: Interactive navigation search box with placeholder text
- **Map Integration**: MapboxGL integration for real-time mapping
- **Quick Access Icons**: Central navigation panel with:
  - Music player access
  - Map/navigation toggle
  - Phone interface
  - Video entertainment system

### Visual Design
- **Automotive UI Principles**: Professional infotainment interface design
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified color scheme and typography
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive components that scale with screen resolution
- **Interactive Feedback**: Hover states and click animations

## Technical Implementation Highlights

### Advanced Qt/QML Integration
```cpp
// Property exposure for seamless data binding
Q_PROPERTY(int targetTemperature READ targetTemperature WRITE setTargetTemperature NOTIFY targetTemperatureChanged)

// Method exposure for QML interaction
Q_INVOKABLE void incrementTargetTemperature(int val);
```

### Component Architecture
- **HVACComponent.qml**: Reusable temperature control with configurable controller binding
- **VolumeControlComponent.qml**: Intelligent audio interface with state management
- **NavigationSearchBox.qml**: Interactive search with dynamic placeholder visibility

### Build System
- **CMake Integration**: Modern build configuration with automatic MOC/UIC processing
- **Resource Compilation**: Embedded assets for efficient deployment
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Linux development with Qt5 framework

## Skills Demonstrated

### C++ Programming
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean class hierarchies with proper encapsulation
- **Qt Framework Mastery**: Property system, signal-slot patterns, meta-object system
- **Memory Management**: RAII principles and Qt's parent-child object model
- **Template Usage**: Generic programming patterns where appropriate

### QML Development
- **Declarative UI**: Component-based interface development
- **Property Binding**: Reactive programming with automatic updates
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions and visual feedback
- **Layout Management**: Responsive design with anchor-based positioning

### Software Engineering
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear component boundaries
- **Version Control**: Git workflow with meaningful commit messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code documentation and project README
- **Build Automation**: CMake configuration for reliable compilation
